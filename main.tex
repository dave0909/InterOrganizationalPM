\title{Trusted Applications for Inter-organizational Process Mining}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
 Through process mining tecniques, organizations enhances their operational efficiency, improve performances, and deepen the understanding of their business processes. While most process mining research focuses on intra-organizational settings, the emerging importance of inter-organizational collaborations for operational excellence cannot be ignored. Inter-organizational business processes involve multiple independent organizations collaborating to achieve mutual interests. However, inter-organizational process mining faces substantial challenges, primarily centered on confidentiality concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on the adoption of trusted applications running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Our research work aims at ensuring privacy preservation and safeguarding the integrity of sensitive information during process mining procedures in inter-organizational contexts. Therefore, we introduce a TEE-based infrastructure supporting the execution of trusted applications through which partner organizations securely share operational information and apply process mining techniques. We show the feasibility of our solution by exposing an healthcare scenario that serve as running example. Our contribution includes a discussion of the proposed research work that addresses strengths and areas for improvement.
