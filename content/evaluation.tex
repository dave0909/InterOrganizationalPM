\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
In the previous section, we illustrated the functioning of the secure event log sharing mechanism through a Trusted Execution Environment.

Yet, it is necessary to evaluate various aspects of the functioning of the illustrated framework, the key point is in how to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the event log generated by the merge of the logs received from all providers.

The goal of this section...


In the remainder of this section, we start comparing the accuracy of the Petri Net generated from the merged log and the Petri Net from the original log so that we can evaluate the accuracy of the generated process model, continue proposing



\subsection{Integrity and Confidentiality}



\subsection{Applicability}
%-log volvo (validation su dati reali)




\subsection{Convergence}
%-petri net log sintetico
