\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
In the preceding section, we expounded upon the functioning of the secure event log sharing mechanism through the use of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). In order to determine the robustness and effectiveness of the framework, it is important to thoroughly evaluate diverse aspects of its operation.
Of particular significance is the assessment of the accuracy and reliability of the event log generated through the amalgamation of logs received from disparate providers. This evaluation is pivotal in establishing the efficacy of the collaborative data exchange process.

The primary objective of this section is to delve into a comprehensive analysis of the convergence between two distinct yet interconnected Petri Nets. \cref{sec:evaluation} The first Petri Net is crafted from the amalgamated event log, which encapsulates the collective data from various organizations. The second Petri Net originates from the unaltered event logs of individual organizations. This comparative study aims to elucidate the congruence and comparability of these two Petri Nets.
