\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both producer and consumer act fairly (so we do not expect to have injected data)
    \item We do not manage TEE crashes
    \item We assume a perfect communication channel (no loss, no snap, no corrupted bits)
    \item Universal clock for event timestamps (cite Event log cleaning for business process analytics by Andreas Solti)
\end{itemize} 
Future Work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Declarative models adaptation
    \item Output inside the TEE, interactions through trusted applications
    \item Real-world event log data
    \item Usage policies integration
    \item Formal interaction protocol
    \item Threat model
    \item Security evaluation
\end{itemize}
