\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}



Future work include the elaboration of an interaction protocol that formalizes the communication workflow between data providers and miners. Additionally, we plan to integrate usage control policies containing terms and conditions on event log utilization. To achieve this goal, we will design dedicated mechanisms inside trusted applications for monitoring usage rules and enforce their fulfillment. The presented solution embraces model process mining techniques in a general way. However, we believe that the technologies employed are particularly suitable for declarative model representations where trusted applications compute and store the entire set of rules representing a business process and users interact with them via trusted queries. We plan to extend the considerations discussed in \cref{sec:evaluation} by integrating threat modeling analysis and quantitative assesments concerning scalability, throughput and performances on real-world event logs.

Limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both producer and consumer act fairly (so we do not expect to have injected data)
    \item We do not manage TEE crashes
    \item We assume a perfect communication channel (no loss, no snap, no corrupted bits)
    \item Universal clock for event timestamps (cite Event log cleaning for business process analytics by Andreas Solti)
\end{itemize} 
Future Work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Declarative models adaptation ok
    \item Output inside the TEE, interactions through trusted applications
    \item Real-world event log data ok
    \item Usage policies integration ok
    \item Formal interaction protocol ok
    \item Threat model ok
    \item Security evaluation ok
\end{itemize}
