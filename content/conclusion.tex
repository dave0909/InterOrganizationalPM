\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Future work include the elaboration of an interaction protocol that formalizes the communication workflow between data providers and miners. Additionally, we plan to integrate usage control policies containing terms and conditions on event log utilization. To achieve this, we will design dedicated mechanisms for monitoring usage rules and enforce their fulfillment inside trusted applications. The presented solution embraces process mining techniques in a general way. However, we believe that the technologies employed are particularly suitable for declarative models.

Limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both producer and consumer act fairly (so we do not expect to have injected data)
    \item We do not manage TEE crashes
    \item We assume a perfect communication channel (no loss, no snap, no corrupted bits)
    \item Universal clock for event timestamps (cite Event log cleaning for business process analytics by Andreas Solti)
\end{itemize} 
Future Work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Declarative models adaptation
    \item Output inside the TEE, interactions through trusted applications
    \item Real-world event log data
    \item Usage policies integration ok
    \item Formal interaction protocol ok
    \item Threat model
    \item Security evaluation
\end{itemize}
