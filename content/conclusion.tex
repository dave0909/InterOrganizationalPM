\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
Limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both producer and consumer act fairly (so we do not expect to have enjected data)
    \item We do not manage TEE crashes
    \item We assume perfect communication channel (no loss, no snap, no corrupted bits)
    \item Universal clock for event timestamps (cite Event log cleaning for business process analytics by  Andreas Salti)
\end{itemize} 
Future Work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Declarative models adaptation
    \item Output inside the TEE, interactions through trusted applications
    \item Real world event log data
    \item Usage policies integration
\end{itemize}
