% Inter-organizational and process mining
The literature proposes several studies that consider process mining techniques in inter-organizational environments. Van Der Aalst~\cite{van2011intra} shows that inter-organizational processes can be divided according to different dimensions making identifiable challenges of inter-organizational process extractions. Elkoumy et al.~\cite{elkoumy2020shareprom} propose a tool that allows independent parts of an organization to perform process mining operations by revealing only the result. This tool is called Shareprom and exploits the features of secure multi-party computation (MPC). Engel et al.~\cite{engel2016analyzing} present EDImine Framework, which allows to apply process mining operations for inter-organizational processes supported by the EDI standard\footnote{https://edicomgroup.com/learning-center/edi/standards} and evaluate their performance using business information.
Elkoumy et al.~\cite{elkoumy2020secure} propose an MPC-based architecture that aims to perform process mining operations without sharing their data or trusting third parties.


% inter-organizational and merge log
Applying process mining techniques in intra-organizational contexts requires merging the event logs of the organizations participating in the process. The literature offers several study in this area. For instance, Hernandez-Resendiz et al.~\cite{hernandez2021merging} present a methodology for merging logs at the trace and activity level using rules and methods to discover the process. Claes et al.~\cite{claes2014merging} provide techniques for performing merge operations in inter-organizational environments. This paper indicates rules for merging data in order to perform process mining algorithms.

%data exchange 
The state of the art provides some studies that investigate issues and possible solutions regarding data exchange, more specifically in an business collaboration context. EDI standards enable the communication of business documents. Among these standards, the notion of process is not explicitly specified. This inhibits organizations from applying Business Process Management (BPM) methods in business collaboration environments. Engel et al.\cite{engel2011process} extended process mining techniques by discovering interaction sequences between business partners based on EDI exchanged documents. Lo et al.\cite{lo2020flexible} have provided and developed a framework for data exchange designed even in intra-organizational situations. This framework is based on blockchain and decentralized public key infrastructure technologies which ensure scalability, reliability data security, and data privacy.

% Use of data from other organizations(or person) integrity ecc ecc (LOCAL)
Additionally, there are several papers that propose solutions for the correct sharing and use of data by third parties. Xie et al.\cite{XIE2023321} propose an architecture for the internet of things based on trusted execution environment and blockchain. The proposed architecture aims to solve data and identity security problems in the process of data sharing. Basile et al.~\cite{Basile_Blockchain_based_resource_governance_for_decentralized_web_environments} in their study created a framework called ReGov that allows the exchange of sensitive information in a decentralized web context, ensuring usage control-based data access and usage. In order to control the consumer's device ReGov uses trusted execution environment that allows storage and utilization management of retrieved resources. Hussain et al.\cite{hussain2021sharing} present a tool for privacy protection and data management among multiple collaborating companies. This tool allows data encryption to be configured according to the privacy obligations dictated by the context of a system's use. 

%The application of process mining in an inter-organizational scenario is infrequent due to concerns related to privacy and confidentiality, integrity and data heterogeneity. To overcome these problems, a large number of techniques have been proposed. Federated process mining \cite{van2021federated} aims to effectively manage the problem of privacy-preserving. Using federated data sources, event data can be transparently mapped between multi-source autonomous provider to monitor, analyze, and improve processes across organizations.
