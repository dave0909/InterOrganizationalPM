%First inspiration work
% Inter-organizational and process mining
\begin{comment}
The work of M{\"u}ller et al.~\cite{muller2021process} is the first contribution that considers TEEs in combination with blockchain technologies for process mining purposes. This research proposes a conceptual architecture in which process mining algorithms are executed inside centralized third-party services. Inspired by this preliminary contribution, we design a decentralized approach context where each organization can run process mining algorithms without involving external stakeholders.
The literature proposes several studies that consider process mining techniques in inter-organizational environments. Van Der Aalst~\cite{van2011intra} shows that inter-organizational processes can be divided according to different dimensions making identifiable challenges of inter-organizational process extractions. Elkoumy et al.~\cite{elkoumy2020shareprom} propose a tool that allows independent parts of an organization to perform process mining operations by revealing only the result. This tool is called Shareprom and exploits the features of secure multi-party computation (MPC). Engel et al.~\cite{engel2016analyzing} present EDImine Framework, which allows to apply process mining operations for inter-organizational processes supported by the EDI standard\footnote{https://edicomgroup.com/learning-center/edi/standards} and evaluate their performance using business information.
Elkoumy et al.~\cite{elkoumy2020secure} propose an MPC-based architecture that aims to perform process mining operations without sharing their data or trusting third parties.
% inter-organizational and merge log
Applying process mining techniques in intra-organizational contexts requires merging the event logs of the organizations participating in the process. The literature offers several studies in this area. For instance, Hernandez-Resendiz et al.~\cite{hernandez2021merging} present a methodology for merging logs at the trace and activity level using rules and methods to discover the process. Claes et al.~\cite{claes2014merging} provide techniques for performing merge operations in inter-organizational environments. This paper indicates rules for merging data in order to perform process mining algorithms.
%data exchange 
The state of the art provides some studies that investigate issues and possible solutions regarding data exchange, more specifically in an business collaboration context. EDI standards enable the communication of business documents. Among these standards, the notion of process is not explicitly specified. This inhibits organizations from applying Business Process Management (BPM) methods in business collaboration environments. Engel et al.\cite{engel2011process} extended process mining techniques by discovering interaction sequences between business partners based on EDI exchanged documents. Lo et al.\cite{lo2020flexible} have provided and developed a framework for data exchange designed even in intra-organizational situations. This framework is based on blockchain and decentralized public key infrastructure technologies, which ensure scalability, reliability, data security, and data privacy.
% Use of data from other organizations(or person) integrity ecc ecc (LOCAL)
Additionally, there are several papers that propose solutions for the correct sharing and use of data by third parties. Xie et al.\cite{XIE2023321} propose an architecture for the internet of things based on TEE and blockchain. The proposed architecture aims to solve data and identity security problems in the process of data sharing. Basile et al.~\cite{Basile_Blockchain_based_resource_governance_for_decentralized_web_environments} in their study created a framework called ReGov that allows the exchange of sensitive information in a decentralized web context, ensuring usage control-based data access and usage. In order to control the consumer's device ReGov uses TEE that allows storage and utilization management of retrieved resources. Hussain et al.\cite{hussain2021sharing} present a tool for privacy protection and data management among multiple collaborating companies. This tool allows data encryption to be configured according to the privacy obligations dictated by the context of a system's use.

% \todo{When do we use blockchain in this paper? If we do not use it, then we should make clear why we do not. Isn't it also the first paper that uses TEE for process mining? If it is, then we omit this blockchain thing and take it back for future work perhaps or as an additional detail.}
This research proposes a conceptual architecture in which process mining algorithms are executed inside centralized third-party services. Inspired by this preliminary contribution, we design a decentralized approach context where each organization can run process mining algorithms without involving external stakeholders. The theme of inter-organizational process mining is discussed in the literature from different perspectives. Van der Aalst~\cite{van2011intra} highlights the challenges of inter-organizational process extraction through a categorization. Elkoumy et al.~\cite{elkoumy2020shareprom} introduce Shareprom, a secure tool for inter-organizational process mining based on secure multi-party computation (MPC). Engel et al.~\cite{engel2016analyzing} present the EDImine Framework, which applies process mining to inter-organizational processes using the EDI standard. In inter-organizational contexts, merging event logs from different organizations is essential. Hernandez-Resendiz et al.~\cite{hernandez2021merging} propose a methodology for log merging, while Claes et al.~\cite{claes2014merging} provide techniques for merging data to support process mining algorithms. Data exchange in business collaboration environments has already been explored in various works. Engel et al.~\cite{engel2011process} extend process mining by analyzing interaction sequences based on EDI documents. Lo et al.~\cite{lo2020flexible} present a blockchain-based framework for secure data exchange, even within inter-organizational scenarios. Lastly, there are solutions for secure data sharing with third parties. Xie et al.~\cite{XIE2023321} propose an IoT architecture using TEE and blockchain. Basile et al.~\cite{Basile_Blockchain_based_resource_governance_for_decentralized_web_environments} introduce ReGov for controlled data utilization in decentralized web contexts.% Hussain et al.~\cite{hussain2021sharing} offers a tool for privacy protection and data management in collaborative settings, allowing data encryption to align with privacy requirements.
