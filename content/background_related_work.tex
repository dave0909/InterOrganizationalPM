\section{Related Work}
The application of process mining in an inter-organizational scenario is infrequent due to concerns related to privacy and confidentiality, integrity and data heterogeneity. To overcome these problems, a large number of techniques have been proposed. Federated process mining [WVDAlst??] aims to effectively manage the problem of privacy-preserving. Using federated data sources, event data can be transparently mapped between multi-source autonomous provider to monitor, analyze, and improve processes across organizations.

Once the data exchange has taken place, it is critical that the data be stored in a trusted part of the consumer's device. Davide et al.~\cite{Basile_Blockchain_based_resource_governance_for_decentralized_web_environments} in their study created a framework called Regov that allows for the exchange of sensitive information in a decentralized web context, ensuring usage control-based data access and usage. To ensure control over the consumer's device, Davide et al. use trusted execution environment that allows storage and utilization management of retrieved resources.
