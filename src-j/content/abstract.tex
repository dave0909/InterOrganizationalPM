Inter-organizational business processes involve multiple independent organizations collaborating to achieve mutual interests. 
Process mining techniques have the potential to allow these organizations to enhance operational efficiency, improve performance, and deepen the understanding of their business based on the recorded process event data. 
However, inter-organizational process mining faces substantial challenges, including topical secrecy concerns: The involved organizations may not be willing to expose their own data to run mining algorithms jointly with their counterparts or third parties. 
In this paper, we introduce CONFINE, a novel approach that unlocks process mining on multiple actors' process event data while safeguarding the secrecy and integrity of the original records in an inter-organizational business setting.
To ensure that the phases of the presented interaction protocol are secure and that the processed information is hidden from involved and external actors alike, our approach resorts to a decentralized architecture comprised of trusted applications running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). We show the feasibility of our solution by showcasing its application to a healthcare scenario and evaluating our implementation in terms of memory usage and scalability on real-world event logs.
