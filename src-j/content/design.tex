In this section, we present the high-level architecture of the CONFINE framework. We consider the main functionalities of each component, avoiding details on the employed technologies discussed in the next sections. %After introducing the architecture, we focus on the \emph{Secure Miner}, a core component of our contribution.

\noindent\textbf{The CONFINE architecture at large.} Our architecture involves different information systems running on multiple machines. An organization can take at least one of the following roles: 
\begin{inparadesc}
%\item[provisioning] if it delivers local event logs to be collaboratively mined;
%\item[mining] if it applies process mining algorithms using event logs retrieved from provisioners.
\item[\NewJ{provisioner}] \NewJ{if it delivers local event logs to be collaboratively mined} (as per \cref{def:provisioner});
\item[miner] if it applies process mining algorithms using event logs retrieved from provisioners.
\end{inparadesc}
In \cref{fig:architecture_diagram}, we propose the high-level schematization of the CONFINE framework.
In our solution, every organization hosts one or more nodes hosting components (the names of which will henceforth be formatted with a \Compo{teletype} font). Depending on the played role, nodes come endowed with a \Compo{Provisioner} or a \Compo{Secure Miner} component, or both. The \Compo{Provisioner} component consists of the following two main sub-components. The \begin{inparadesc}
\item[\Compo{Log Recorder}] registers the events (introduced in \cref{def:evt}) taking place in the organizations' systems\NewJ{, and builds the provisioner's log partition (according to \cref{def:partition})}.
\item[\Compo{Log Provider}] delivers %on-demand
\NewJ{log partitions} to mining players.
\end{inparadesc}
The \Actor{Hospital} and all other parties in our example record Alice and Bob's cases using the \Compo{Log Recorder}. The \Compo{Log Recorder} is queried by the \Compo{Log Provider} for event logs to be made available for mining. The latter controls access to local %event logs 
\NewJ{log partitions} by authenticating data requests by miners and rejecting those that come from unauthorized parties.
In our motivating scenario, the \Actor{Specialized clinic}, the \Actor{Pharmaceutical company}, and the \Actor{Hospital} leverage \Compo{Log Provider}s to authenticate the miner party before sending their log partition. The \Compo{Secure Miner} component
% \Compo{Log Provider}s reject demands from unauthorized parties and only permit \texttt{Secure Miners} to use the data. 
% The \Compo{Secure Miner}
shelters external event logs inside a protected environment to preserve data confidentiality and integrity.
Notice that \Compo{Log Provider}s accept requests issued solely by \Compo{Secure Miner}s. 
Next, we provide an in-depth focus on the latter.

\noindent\textbf{The Secure Miner.}
The primary objective of the \Compo{Secure Miner} is to allow miners to securely execute process mining algorithms using event logs retrieved from provisioners such as the \Actor{Specialized clinic}, \Actor{Pharmaceutical company}, and the \Actor{Hospital} in our example. \Compo{Secure Miner}s are isolated components that guarantee data inalterability and confidentiality. In \cref{fig:trusted_miner}, we show a schematization of the \Compo{Secure Miner}, which consists of four sub-components:
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape(i)\upshape]
    \item \Compo{Log Requester};
    \item \Compo{Log Receiver};
    \item \Compo{Log Manager}; 
    \item \Compo{Log Elaborator}.
\end{inparaenum}
%Event logs belonging to provisioners are locked in the \Compo{Secure Miner}.
%We handle  data via the 
The \Compo{Log Requester} and the \Compo{Log Receiver} are the sub-components that we employ during the event log retrieval. \Compo{Log Requester}s send authenticable data requests to the \Compo{Log Provider}s. The \Compo{Log Receiver} collects event logs sent by \texttt{Log Providers} and entrusts them to the \Compo{Log Manager}, securing them from accesses that are external to the \Compo{Secure Miner}.
Miners of our motivating scenario, such as the \Actor{University} and the \Actor{National Institute of Statistics}, employ these three components to retrieve and store Alice and Bob's data. The \Compo{Log Elaborator} merges the event data locked in the \Compo{Secure Miner} to have a global view of the inter-organizational process comprehensive of activities executed by each involved party. Thereupon, it executes process mining algorithms in a protected environment, inaccessible from the outside computation environment.
In our motivating scenario, the \Compo{Log Elaborator} combines the traces associated with the cases of Alice (i.e., $T^H_{312}$, $T^S_{312}$, and $T^C_{312}$) and Bob (i.e, $T^H_{711}$, $T^S_{711}$, and $T^C_{711}$), generates the chronologically sorted traces $T_{312}$ and $T_{711}$, and feeds them into the mining algorithms (see the bottom-right quadrant of \cref{tab:trace}).
