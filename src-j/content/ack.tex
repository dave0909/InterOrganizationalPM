\todo[inline]{\textbf{EXTENSION PLAN}:\\
Extended introduction\\
Add Background Section\\
Add more related work\\
Modify the motivating scenario (and the design alongside the implementation) with more attributes involved in the event event log (for example, the famous ID that might not be shared among providers, many of those having differing attributes and codes to refer to an instance.\\
Add Notation and formalization of event logs, merging, partitioning and segmentation\\
Add Soundness and completeness theorems\\
Add threat model\\
Full pseudocode of the protocol\\
More real-world event logs (plus two, at least) with associated tests\\
Add communication overhead v.\ segment size charts: elab time vs segment size; total time (incl.\ network) vs segment size.\\
%Add latency comparison between with TEE and without TEE settings (if we have a TEE)\\
Integrate declarative conformance checking (let it be with Janus or MINERful).
