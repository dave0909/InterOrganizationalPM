Add Soundness and completeness theorems\\
\textbf{Add threat model $\bigvee$}\\

More real-world event logs (plus two, at least) with associated tests\\
Add communication overhead v.\ segment size charts: elab time vs segment size; total time (incl.\ network) vs segment size.\\
%Add latency comparison between with TEE and without TEE settings (if we have a TEE)\\
Integrate declarative conformance checking (let it be with Janus or MINERful).\\
