In the following section, we identify the threats that can jeopardize the proper functioning of CONFINE. Our threat analysis is based upon the theoretical foundation of the \textit{STRIDE} framework \cite{aa}. This conceptual model groups the threats into six categories: spoofing (i.e., the impersonation of a legitimate entity), tampering (i.e., the modification of data to alter its integrity), repudiation (i.e., the denial of performing a particular action), information disclosure (i.e., the exposure of sensitive data), denial of service (i.e., the disruption or degradation of availability) and elevation of privileges (i.e., the misappropriation of higher level of rights). 

With the help of the dataflow depicted in \cref{fig:threatmodel:dataflow}, we demarcate the \textit{trust boundaries} among the CONFINE components. In our diagram, a trust boundary box (a red dashed square) groups entities with mutual trust. Differently, trust boundary arches (red dashed curved lines) mark the transitions of trust level on the occasion of data exchanges between mutually untrusted interactors. We identified the three main trust boundaries: the Secure Miner's trust boundary (\textbf{TB01}), the inter-organizational trust boundary (\textbf{TB02}), and the intra-organizational trust boundary (\textbf{TB03}). As a result of our analysis, we collect in \cref{table:threatmodel:threats} the CONFINE threats according to the STRIDE taxonomy.

We address the identified threats, grouping them according to the threat boundary they refer to.  
	
%The trust boundary box TB01 groupes the components of the \Compo{Secure Miner}. The spectrum of the possible attacks to this boundary aims at breaking the isolation layer separating the \Compo{Secure Miner}'s component from untrusted entities. In order to disclosure the \Compo{Secure Miner}'s confidential information, a malicious actor may get access to the memory portion allocated to the \Compo{Secure Miner} (e.g., via Direct Memory Access attack) revealing event log's sensitive information (\textbf{T04}). Tampering threats manifest as the manipulation of the \Compo{Secure Miner}'s source code and event log data to generate misbehaviours or introducing vulnerabilities (\textbf{T05}). Furthermore, a malicious actor could acquire the necessary privileges (e.g., via kernel exploits) to execute code within the isolated context of the \Compo{Secure Miner}, potentially leading to unauthorized access or malicious code injection (\textbf{T06}). A denial-of-service attack may be employed a malicious entity to crash, halt, or disrupt the functioning of the \Compo{Secure Miner}, thereby impeding its ability to correctly aggregate event logs data and provide output analytics (\textbf{T07}).
The trust boundary box TB01 encloses the components of the \Compo{Secure Miner}. The spectrum of potential attacks targeting this trust domain aims to undermine the isolation layer that separates the components of the \Compo{Secure Miner} from untrusted entities. Attacks against this trust boundary may emanate from a generic entity, which could be either intra-organizational (i.e., within the same organization as the \Compo{Secure Miner}) or inter-organizational (i.e., beyond the boundaries of the \Compo{Secure Miner}'s organization). To expose the confidential information within the \Compo{Secure Miner}, a malicious actor might gain access to the memory allocated to the \Compo{Secure Miner}, for instance, through a Direct Memory Access attack\cite{cita}, thereby revealing event logs' sensitive information (\textbf{T04}). Tampering threats materialize in the form of manipulating the \Compo{Secure Miner}'s source code and event log data to induce misbehaviors or introduce vulnerabilities (\textbf{T05}). Furthermore, a malicious actor could obtain the necessary privileges, such as through kernel exploits, to execute code within the isolated context of the \Compo{Secure Miner}, potentially resulting in unauthorized access or the injection of malicious code (\textbf{T06}). A denial-of-service attack may be employed by a malicious entity to crash, halt, or disrupt the functioning of the \Compo{Secure Miner}, thereby hindering the aggregation event log data correctly and the outsourcing of result analytics (\textbf{T07}). 

%TB02 shows the trust transition between the \Compo{Secure Miner} and the \Compo{Provisioner}. In this case, the attacker could interfere in the data transmission process through which event logs are delivered from the \Compo{Provisioner} to the \Compo{Secure Miner}. A spoofing attack could lead to the \Compo{Secure Miner} impersonation to improperly receive the \Compo{Provisioner}'s event log (\textbf{TB08}). Similarly, if an attacker impersonates a \Compo{Provisioner}, it could send fake event logs to affect the data analytics output. The log delivery service could be interrupted by one or more malicious entities that generate an outsized number of data requests (e.g., via DDoS attack) toward the target \Compo{Provisioner} (\textbf{TB10}). A man in the middle attack, such as eavesdropping or packet sniffing, could enable a third-party actor to monitor the dataflow between the \Compo{Secure Miner} and the \Compo{Provisioner}, making it capable of disclosing personal information (\textbf{TB11}) or alter meaningful data (\textbf{TB12}). 
TB02  encompasses inter-organizational concerns between the \Compo{Secure Miner} and the \Compo{Provisioner}. Considering this specific setting, an attacker may disrupt the data transmission process responsible for delivering event logs from the \Compo{Provisioner} to the \Compo{Secure Miner}. A spoofing attack could result in the \Compo{Secure Miner} being impersonated, leading to the improper reception of the \Compo{Provisioner}'s event log (\textbf{TB08}). Similarly, if an attacker successfully impersonates a \Compo{Provisioner}, it could send fabricated event logs to manipulate the data analytics output. Furthermore, the log delivery service may be interrupted by one or more malicious entities generating an excessive number of data requests (e.g., through a DDoS attack) targeting the \Compo{Provisioner} (\textbf{TB10}). A man-in-the-middle attack, such as eavesdropping or packet sniffing, could allow a third-party actor to monitor the data flow between the \Compo{Secure Miner} and the \Compo{Provisioner}, thereby enabling the disclosure of personal information (\textbf{TB11}) or the alteration of meaningful data (\textbf{TB12}).
