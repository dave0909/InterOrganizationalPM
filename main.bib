abstract = {The European Commission supports the production of renewable biological resources and their conversion into value added products and bio-energy. A new bioeconomy strategy aimed at promoting a sustainable Europe was launched in October 2018. However, little work has been done to monitor, model and appraise the impacts and developmental trajectories of bioeconomy sectors. To gauge the current sustainability performance of individual European countries, the present study proposes a new indicator – the “socio-economic indicator for the bioeconomy” (SEIB) – to measure the socio-economic performance of bioeconomy sectors. Drawing on Eurostat data and the analytic hierarchy process, multi-criteria decision analysis is employed with the aim of providing a direct comparison between member states (MSs). However, bioeconomy involves a large number of sectors and, therefore, it is useful to propose two versions of this indicator in order also to single out the impact of most innovative sectors: the first version considers all bio-based sectors (“SEIB for overall sectors”) while the second version excludes all primary sectors (“SEIB for manufacturing and bio-energy sectors”). The results identify three groups of MSs (virtuous, in-between and laggard) with reference to the European average. Ireland occupies the first position in the ranking, and only three other MSs (Denmark, Portugal and Austria) qualify as “virtuous” countries in both rankings.}

abstract="Following Roy (1985), we will say that decision-aid consists in trying to provide answers to questions raised by actors involved in a decision process using a clearly specified model. In order to do so, the analyst often has to compare ``alternatives'' (see Vincke, 1989). In an approach using several criteria, the analyst aims at establishing comparisons on the basis of the evaluation of the alternatives according to several criteria. In an approach using a single criterion, the analyst seeks to build a unique criterion taking into account all the relevant aspects of the problem. In either approach, the success of decision-aid crucially depends upon the way in which the unique criterion or the family of criteria have been built. The aim of this paper is to emphasize the importance of this phase by a number of frequently encountered difficulties and some techniques to overcome them.",
